# 1. Project Brief

We are working as data analysts for one of the largest privately held, family-owned spirits companies in the world, Bacardi. The scope of the project involves building a soundable model to predict sales based on volume. Through this work we also aim to identify trends within different countries among the most representative categories the company is producing.

# 2. Data

Bacardi provided us with Digital Commerce sales data for the US and the Big5 EU countries. Given the depth of the dataset, we harnessed data from external sources and applied some extra creativity to enhance our model's predictions. Preparing our main dataframe required some previous cleaning. 
As the EU is an already relevant market we dropped the US from our analysis. We also dropped some irrelevant columns, mainly using python.

  ### 2.1 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

To explore the data we used, Tableau, a visualization software that allowed us understand and gain insights about the company's products, markets and   other relevant information.

# 3. Statistical Modeling

Our first approach to estimate volume was through statistical models. The ARIMA model predicts future values based on past volumes. Given the seasonality patterns eexisting in this particular industry, we advanced our model to capture the concept of seasonal trends, ie. SARIMA.

# 4. Machine Learning Process

  ### 4.1 Data Engineering 

In order to create a solid machine learning model we worked thoroughly in excel, adding relevant features to the dataset. One of our main datasources was Bloomberg, which we used to gather consumer confidence and temperature data. Additionally we obtained data from the European Comission and movement data from Facebook. Ultimately we added a feature matching the seasons of the year given the seasonality nature of the demand and sales for the industry.   

  ### 4.1 Modeling
  
 With our expanded data set we were ready to head into the modeling process. We started by boosting our data through selecting the most important features. This we accomplished by using the feature importances method of the random forest regression. In the second step we used the same model to create our first forecast.  The data we receive from bacardi only spanned over the course of three years, thus making it hard to set up a proper train and test scenario. Because of this we decided to stabilise our model as far as possible via ###stacking###. Through this process we combined the regression models: RandomForest, K-Nearest-Neighbours and Linear Regression.

# 5.Tools

    Python - Jupyter Notebooks for prediction and machine learning model implementations.

    Excel for data engineering and pre-processing

    Tableau Public for visualization and analysis. Used also for the presentation (graphics)

    Google Slides for presentation template and contents

    GitHub for repositories and data files
    
    Trello for project management

# 6. Conclusion

We believe that COVID-19 pandemic affected key trends driving the global beverage alcohol industry, especially in the e-commerce sector. The industry has proven itself to be one of the most crisis-proof consumer goods categories at a time of significant disruption. Even though consumers are very keen returning to the on-trade channels digital Commerce has emerged in strength.
