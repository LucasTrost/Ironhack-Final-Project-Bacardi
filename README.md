# 1. Project Brief

We are working as data analysts for one of the largest privately held, family-owned spirits companies in the world, Bacardi. The projects goal involves building a soundable model to predict sales based on volume. 

Through this work we also aim to identify country specific trends among the company's most represented categories.

# 2. Data

Bacardi provided us with Digital Commerce sales data for the US and the Big5 EU countries, which required only minimal cleaning and some forms of reformatting (dropping features). As the files only included data concerning the fiscal years: 2020, 2021, and 2022, we harnessed data from external sources, to enhance our model's predictions. 

We also adjusted the scope of our project by excluding the US market from our analysis.

  ### 2.1 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

To explore the data we used, Tableau, a visualization software that allowed us understand and gain insights about the company's products, markets and   other relevant information.

  ### Proclaimer: 
 Due to company regulations, data sets will not be published.

# 3. Statistical Modeling

Our first approach to estimate volume was through statistical modeling. The **ARIMA** model for example, predicts future values purely based on existing patterns. Given the seasonal fluctuations in the demand of liquor, we advanced our model to be able to capture said fluctuations, i.e. **SARIMA**.

# 4. Machine Learning Process

  ### 4.1 Data Engineering 

In order to create a solid machine learning model we had to engineer our added, and existing features into usable forms/formats . 

One of our main datasources was Bloomberg, which we used to gather consumer confidence and temperature data. Additionally we obtained data from the European Comission and movement data from Facebook. 

Ultimately we added a feature matching the seasons of the year given the seasonality nature of the demand and sales for the industry.   

  ### 4.1 Modeling
  
With our expanded data set we were ready to head into the modeling process. 

We started by **boosting** our data through selecting the most important features. This we accomplished by using the feature importances method of the random forest regression. 

In the second step we used the same model to create our first forecast.  The data we receive from bacardi only spanned over the course of three years, thus making it hard to set up a proper train and test scenario. 

Because of this we decided to stabilise our model as far as possible via **stacking**. Through this process we combined the regression models: RandomForest, K-Nearest-Neighbours and Linear Regression.

# 6. Conclusion

Overall, we were capable of constructing two models. Both capable of forecasting Volume, adjusted for the seasonality of Bacardi's demand. Here, the machine learning model takes a more adamant, conservative approach, while the statistical model is confident in a further increase in volume, which we saw especially during the pandemic and after.

Trends can be explored excessively inside of our [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/lucas.trost/viz/Ironhack-Final-Project-Barcardi/CountryForecast) workbook. Two examples would be the large increase in demand for Vermuth in Spain, and the increased preference of non-alcoholic beverages in Germany.
